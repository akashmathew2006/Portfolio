2. Download this folder as a ZIP, unzip it, and **upload all files** to that repo (or push with Git).
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and choose **Deploy from branch**, **main**, **/ (root)**. Save.
4. Your site will be live at **https://your-username.github.io** (or `/repo-name` if using a project site).

## ðŸ”§ Customize
- Replace placeholders in `index.html` for:
  - GitHub & LinkedIn links (`your-github-username`, `your-linkedin-handle`)
  - Project links (`#` â†’ actual repo URLs)
- Drop a photo at `assets/profile.jpg`, then update the `<img>` src if you prefer (or keep the SVG placeholder).
- Update your details in the sections. Everything is simple HTML.

## ðŸ§© Local development
Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.
